# Data-Science-Bootcamp-Capstone---Car-Insurance

This is a capstone project for my Data Science Bootcamp with Vertical Institute.

Problem Statement:
- Car insurance provides vehicle owners financial protection against medical and liability costs arising from traffic incidents.
- Using given data(features and target), develop a model using machine learning to predict whether an individual will or will not make claim.
- To improve from baseline prediction model by tuning hyper-parameter, on whether a car insurance claim was made with given features.
